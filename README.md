## TODO

* ~~enable functionality only on specific domains, e.g. srf.ch~~
* ~~get a list of all lobbywatch entities (PMs, lobbyists)~~
* discover such entities in article texts of srf.ch - better algorithm (Timo)
* order connections by potency (descending) (Angelo) 
* ~~load interests for such entities from Lobbywatch API~~
* display interests in the best possible form -> UX
* move interests box to the bottom (Angelo)

### Future

* inline annotations
* show only high potency connections and low on demand (Angelo)
